# NetworkStorage

A Minecraft plugin that allows players to create a centralized storage network.

## Features

*   Create a network of chests to store your items.
*   Access all your items from a single terminal.
*   Trust other players to access your network.
*   Track player deposits and withdrawals 
*   Wireless access to your network with a wireless terminal (compass-based item).
*   Craftable storage terminal block, wireless terminal, and wand; recipes configurable in `config.yml`.
*   **Configurable Network Modes:** Choose between individual player networks or a single, server-wide global network.
*   **Optional Trust System:** Make networks publicly accessible, perfect for cooperative servers.

## Commands

*   `/storage wand`: Get the storage wand.
*   `/storage terminal`: Get the storage network terminal block item.
*   `/storage info`: View your network information.
*   `/storage trust <player>`: Trust a player to your network.
*   `/storage untrust <player>`: Untrust a player from your network.
*   `/storage wireless`: Get a wireless terminal.

Permissions for give commands use `networkstorage.give.wand`, `networkstorage.give.terminal`, and `networkstorage.give.wireless` (see `plugin.yml`).

## How to Use

1.  Use `/storage wand` to get a storage wand.
2.  Right-click with the wand to create a new network.
3.  Left-click on chests with the wand to add them to your network.
4.  Craft or obtain a terminal block and place it (it links to your network automatically), or use a wireless terminal from anywhere you have access.

The terminal remembers each player’s last sort mode and search filter (`plugins/NetworkStorage/player-state.yml`).

## Important Notes

### Network Modes (`network-mode`)

In the `config.yml`, you can choose between two modes:

*   **`PLAYER` (Default):** Each player has their own private network. This is the classic behavior.
*   **`GLOBAL`:** There is only one, single, massive network for the entire server. All players share this one network. Commands like `/storage trust` or `/network` are disabled in this mode.

### Trust System (`enable-trust-system`)

This option is only relevant in `PLAYER` mode:

*   **`true` (Default):** Only the owner and players they have added via `/storage trust` can access a network.
*   **`false`:** The trust system is completely disabled. **Every player can access every network.** Ideal for small, private servers where everyone works together.

Trust checks apply to terminals and wireless access. Physical storage chests are still normal Minecraft chests, so use your server's land-claim or block-protection plugin if players should not open them directly.

### Safety Compatibility

*   Storage wands and wireless terminals must be created by this plugin. Items that only match the display name are rejected intentionally, because renamed legacy items cannot be distinguished from forged items.
*   New network names are limited to 1-32 characters: letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, hyphens, and apostrophes. This keeps names safe for YAML-backed storage.

### Language and Item Search

*   **Display:** The names of items in the terminal are always displayed in the language you have set in your Minecraft client (e.g., German, French, etc.).
*   **Search:** The search function works with the internal, English material names (e.g., `diamond`, `stone`, `iron_ingot`) or with custom names you have given an item using an anvil. This means you must search in English, even if the items are displayed in your own language.
